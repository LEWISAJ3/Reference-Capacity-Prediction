This data analysis is created using two main data sets. The first is a series of experiments on Lithium Ion batteries done by NASA.
This can be found under the data section at https://labinfo.ing.he-arc.ch/gitlab/ticc/16TICc19/nasa-battery-dataset/-/tree/master?ref_type=heads
The other data set is similar and incorporates a stochastic element (random walk).
